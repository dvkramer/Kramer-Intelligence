# Privacy Policy
Last Updated: September 20, 2025

## Introduction
Welcome to Kramer Intelligence ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our application, Kramer Intelligence. Please read this policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.

## Information We Collect
We collect information that is essential to provide and improve our service. The information we collect depends on how you use our application.

### 1. Information You Provide to Us
When you choose to create an account, we collect your email address. This is used solely for authentication and to associate saved chats with your account.

We collect the content you provide during your conversations, which includes:

- **Text**: Any questions, prompts, and information you type.
- **File Uploads**: Images (PNG, JPG, WEBP, HEIC, HEIF) and PDFs that you attach to your messages.

### 2. Information Collected Automatically
To provide more contextually relevant responses, our backend service uses your IP address to determine your approximate location (city and region). This is sent to the Gemini API as part of the prompt but is not stored in our database.

## How We Use Your Information
Our use of your information is strictly limited to the core functionality of the Kramer Intelligence application. Your chat content, file uploads, and approximate location are sent to Google's Gemini API to generate responses. We do not use this information for any other purpose. Your email address is used to authenticate you, allow you to log in, and manage your saved chats. If you choose to save a chat to the cloud, we store your conversation history in our Firebase database to allow you to access it later and share it with other users.

## Data Storage, Security, and Retention

### Unsaved Chats (Default Behavior)
If you are using Kramer Intelligence without creating an account, or are using it with an account but do not explicitly save the chat, your conversation history exists transiently. It is sent to the Gemini API for processing but is not logged or stored on our servers or database. Your history will be lost upon closing the app.

### Saved Chats (Logged-in Users)
When you save a chat, the conversation is stored in our Google Firebase Firestore database. Firebase provides industry-standard encryption to protect your data from unauthorized external access. As the developers of this application, we have administrative access to the database. While we can view saved chat data, our policy is to not access user content unless it is necessary for troubleshooting a user-reported issue or as required by law. We retain your saved chats as long as your account is active. You can delete your saved chats at any time, which will permanently remove them from our database.

## Third-Party Services
We rely on third-party services to operate our application. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.

- **Google (Gemini API & Firebase)**: Kramer Intelligence is powered by Google's Gemini API. All chat content (including files) is processed by the Google Gemini API to generate responses. Our user authentication and database are handled by Google Firebase. By using our app, you acknowledge that your information will be handled in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.

- **IP-API.com**: We use this service to determine your approximate geographic location from your IP address. This information is used solely to tailor the AI responses. The location data may be stored in the chat history if you choose to save a chat to the cloud. If your chat is not saved to the cloud, your location data is not logged or stored by us.

## Your Choices and Rights
You have control over your information. You can use the core functionality of Kramer Intelligence without creating an account. In this mode, none of your chat history is saved by us. If you have an account, you can access and delete your saved chats through the application interface. Deleting a chat is a permanent action.

Kramer Intelligence is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.
