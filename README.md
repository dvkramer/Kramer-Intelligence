# Kramer Intelligence

Kramer Intelligence is an AI assistant powered by the Gemini 2.5 series of models. It can answer questions, search the web, and read documents.

## Try it out

Kramer Intelligence is 100% free of charge. Try it out at [kramerintel.vercel.app](https://kramerintel.vercel.app). No API key and no login required.

## Privacy

This app is powered by the Gemini API, so do not put any information in that you are uncomfortable with Google being able to see.

If you do not save your chat to the cloud, there is zero logging on my end.

If you save your chat to the cloud, it is stored in Firebase. It is encrypted, so it is safe from the outside world, but as the developer I can theoretically read your chats. I am not a weirdo and I don't even know how to do this, but Gemini told me it's possible and so I feel it's only right to disclose this.

## Windows App

Kramer Intelligence is finally available on Windows! Download the Webview2 app from [Releases](../../releases).
