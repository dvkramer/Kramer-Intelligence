I haven't been maintaining the Windows app because it's more fun to vibecode than to vibemaintain. Soon enough I'll maybe come up with a workflow to support auto-updates inherited from the website so it can stay up to date.
It's still totally functional, supports editing and regen and images and all that, but it does not support cloud features or study mode.
